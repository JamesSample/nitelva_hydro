# Assessing the impacts of hydromorphological modifications to Nitelva (Oslo Nordmarka)

Code and hydrological analysis for NIVA project **Problemkartlegging av kraftverk i Nitelva** (2019/10177).

## Background

Flows in Nitelva, in Oslo's Nordmarka, are affected by several small hydropower schemes dating from the early 1900s, plus drinking water transfers to neighbouring catchments. The code in this repository applies a simple area-scaling methodology to estimate "natural" (i.e. unmodified) flows for the Nitelva catchment. The aim is to support a broader project considering improved management options for this watershed, which is protected due to its high biodiversity.

## Data analysis notebooks

 1. **[Estimating flow duration curves for Fossen](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/nitelva_hydro/blob/master/python/nitelva_hydro.ipynb)**. This notebook explores available datasets and uses area-scaling to estimate "natural" flow duration curves for the Nitelva at Fossen. These are then compared to observed data to give an indication of the extent to which morphological alteration has affected the flow regime
